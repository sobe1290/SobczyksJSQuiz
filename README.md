# SobczyksJSQuiz

This is a ten question, multiple choice, Javascript Quiz. The results are stored locally so the quiz can be repeated and the scores are saved locally in the user's browser. 

This quiz was constructed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This quiz was created as a part of a coding challenge for a coding bootcamp. I plan on returning at a later date and polishing the styling more when I have more time.

The live deployment of the quiz can be viewed here:


Below are screenshots of the quiz.
